        A month ago, I told everyone about
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/startit-up/how-i-became-a-full-stack-software-developer-in-7-months-self-taught-583bb3e21ebb"

          >how I became a Full Stack Software Developer</a
        >
        in about 7 months. That post reached out to so many people, so here's
        more!

        Right now, I believe in <strong> project based learning</strong> (try
        building a project and learn things along the way because of it).
      </p>
      <p>
        But before building a project, it is good to have a little bit of
        understanding about the concepts.

      <blockquote>
        There are a lot of YouTube channels that can teach you web development.
        Honestly, stop experimenting every channel and just pick one!

      <p>Let's not beat around the bush now.</p>
      <p>
        Here are some free and paid resources that helped me land the internship
        and later the full time position.
      </p>
      <h2>

        (paid)
      </h2>

      <p>
        For the full stack web development, I bought the
        <a
          href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/"
          target="_blank"
          title="Link to Udemy"
          >&quot;The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp&quot;</a
        >
        course by Angela Yu (in my time, it was the year 2022).
      </p>
      You can get it for about INR 449 on Udemy.
      <p>
        I found this course to be well taught. Most of the web dev topics were
        included, along with some terminal/command line commands and tips on
        general things like how to study and how to keep moving forward with the
        topics.
      </p>
      <h2>Free resources</h2>
      <p>
        Now, my tech stack (the technologies that I work with excluding HTML,
        CSS and JavaScript) include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Next.js</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>
          <ol>
            <li>een</li>
            <li>twee</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>React Native</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Therefore, some YouTube channels that I recommend to everyone are:</p>
      <h2>For frontend development</h2>
      <h3>Web Dev Simplified</h3>
      <p>(Videos about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.)</p>
      <p>
        Pretty great YouTube channel to get started in web development.<br />Honestly,
        one of the first channels that introduced me to the world of web dev.
